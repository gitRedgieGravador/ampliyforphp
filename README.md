# TO DO
A client asks you to upload his presentation page (PHP file attached) to the web.

Here are your instructions:
1. Change the name to your name
2. Upload to AWS, making it runnable and visible to the public
3. Without touching the code, upgrade the version number to 1.1
4. Share the website URL back to your client (me ;) as a proof of your work "# ampliyforphp"
